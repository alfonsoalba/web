I'm Alfonso. I'm currently working really hard on becoming a better version of myself, to grow as a person and become a better a professional. 
What do I do for a living? I'm a rails fullstack developer working in a relly cool project with a great team of people. 
I'm also an IT trainer/teacher. I've developed a git course that is helping a lot of teams to stop struggling with git and start using it
like pros!!
 

I'm starting this blog for several reasons:

* _Share:_ I've learn a ton of things from other people's blogs. People who helped me solved problems or inspired me in very different ways.
I hope I can also help or inspire others.
* _Improve my english:_ living in Spain and working in a company in which spanish is the main language (by te time being at least) does not 
help much in improving my english. Watching series and movies in english helps but I do not have much opportunities to talk or write in english.
This blog will help me with the latter.
* _Learn:_ I've followed the course [10 Steps to Learn Anything Quickly](https://simpleprogrammer.com/products/#learn-anything-quickly) from Simple 
Programmer. I'm learning new things every day, all the time. That's something that I love about being a developer: you never stop learning. However, 
I usually got frustrated in the process. I mean, I'm aware that some things take some time to learn, and even though I learn it, I just feel frustrated, 
or dumb or stupid or all of them at the same time. That course helped understand why... And now, well, all the frustration is gone. This course also
inspired me to start this blog.

And that's it. See you around!

This week I gave a talk for the Madrid Git users group. In the talk, I introduced
the `git-worktree` command and showed its basic usage. This is a quick post to 
share with all of you the links and resources related to that talk. 

The talk was in Spanish and it was live-streamed on 
[twitch.tv](https://www.twitch.tv/cursodegit). If you'd like

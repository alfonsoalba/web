  In March this year, we had the first big lock down due to COVID-19. I used that
  extra time at home at the beginning of the spring season to rethink the way 
  I use my computer to work. I decided to change it.

## TL;DR;

The last time I used the Windows Operating system to do anything different than playing games was at the beginning of this century, around 2003. Since then, I've only used
Unix-like operating systems (like Linux and OS-X) to do my job. 
This year I've decided I want to be able to do my jobs using OSX, Linux and 
Windows 10 and in this post I tell you why.

## It all started with a blog post...

Last year, in August, I found a link in [RubyWeekly issue #461](https://rubyweekly.com/issues/461) to an article from Scott Hanselman titled
[_Ruby on Rails on Windows is not just possible, it's fabulous using WSL2 and VS Code_](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/ruby-on-rails-on-windows-is-not-just-possible-its-fabulous-using-wsl2-and-vs-code).

I click and read the article and it really got my attention.

I had never seen Windows as an option to do my job until I read that article.
It made me remember why I discarded Windows long time ago: it was because it 
sucked so much compared to Unix. There was no package manager, the terminal (`cmd`)
was horrible, installing and developing rails was difficult and compiling 
certain gems and their and dependencies could be really frustrating. 
But that was almost 20 years ago. 
So I started to do some research to see what this Windows 10 OS had that made it so 
appealing to Scott Hanselman.

I installed a windows 10 virtual machine and tried the desktop, all the things that I hated
from window 8 were gone and it was good. I liked it. During this research, I learned about
WLS, WSL2, and how they have been working to make things work better and faster.
And I think that Microsoft has
been doing a great job to integrate with Linux. 


During this research, I read a lot of articles about people switching from Mac to windows,
things they liked and they didn't, applications the missed and what alternatives they used. You tube and the internet is full of posts and videos about this topic.

I started to find more and more people saying that developing in windows now was 
something very close to do it in OSX or Linux thanks to WSL. That they were 
able to install packages using APT, that the system was performant, and the experience
was great.

By the end of last year, I bought a new computer and what I read had enough impact 
on me. I even looked at the prices and specs of Surface 2 and Dell computers 
so I would replace my old MacBook Pro with a Windows box. 
Unfortunately for Microsoft and Dell, Apple released
the new 16-inch MacBook Pro in the last quarter I finally decided to buy it instead.

But what I read about Windows really got into my mind. I started to follow 
how WSL was evolving and how WSL2 was released in May this year with Windows 10 version 2004.
I learned how 
[WSL 2 integrated with Docker Desktop for Windows and how the performance was much better](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/wsl/). 

But I was not sure about leaving OSX and replacing it with Windows 10. It was a big
step and a difficult decision. Then I remembered what I read in the book "Decidete"
If your decision comes to two options then you should revisit your options.

Man, that booked has helped me a lot. Wouldn't it be better to learn to be a productive developer
in both operating systems? Better than that, wouldn't it be great to be productive
in OS X, Windows 10 and Linux?






By the end of last year I was going to by a new computer and I was seriously thinking about 
buying a Surface 2 computer. Fortunately, Apple release the new 16 inch MacBook pro
which fixed the keyboard issues and could be upgraded to 64GB of RAM, and I finally decided to buy it.

I got my computer at the begining of January. That month I left the company I was working at 
and I focused mainly in giving courses. Unfortunately, in march came the
big lock down in Spain due to COVID-19. By the 15th of march, I found myself with 
no job at all, since all the courses that I had scheduled for the first six months of the year
were canceled.

I was lucky enough to land a job as Devop Engineer at platform161 in April.
